### Notes

The soaking liquid is about 830mL, you can change amount of liquid per indredient as long as its that amount of liquid.

### Variations

Add coconut milk to the soaking liquid and remove whole milk and adjust ratios of other milks. For topper add rum and then finish with toasted coconut!

Also you could be more traditional and add cinnamon to the cream and or soaking liquid or cake.
