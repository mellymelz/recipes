# Easy Spanakopita

#### feel free to use full fat ingredients or go lower fat for the feta... Up to you!

## Ingredients
- 2 lbs of fresh spinach
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 8 green onions, chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1.25 cups egg whites, beaten (1 egg = 0.25cups of egg white carton)
- 1 lb feta cheese, crumbled
- 12 phyllo pastry sheets for pie style, or 18 full sheets if you want to make large individual portions
  
## Method
- Preheat oven to 350F
- Loosely chop spinach, place in a large bowl and set aside.
- Heat oil in a pan.
- Saute garlic and green onions until tender and fragrant, add to bowl of spinach.
- Add beaten egg and crumbled feta to bowl with spinach.
- Stir to combine (I get my hands in there and massage it a lil bit - its a BIG bowl!)
### (FOR WHOLE PIE STYLE)
- Later 6 phyllo sheets in pan, oil lightly with olive oil before adding next sheet, or an olive oil mister.
- Place spinach mixture on top of the phyllo.
- Layer 6 more phyllo sheets, oiling as you did with the first 6.
- Bake for 45-60 minutes or until golden brown top.
- Sprinkle with paprika and cut into squares.
### (FOR INDIVIDUAL x18)
- Portion the spinach into 18 piles.
- Take a sheet of phyllo, lightly oil then fold in half so it is a thinner rectangle.
- Place pile of filling an inch or so from the bottom, leave space on all sides
- Roll up once or twice, then fold the edges over, use a little oil to seal.
- Finish rolling to the top and you should have a nice little rectangle bundle!
- Freeze individually or bake as you like, they take more like a half hour to bake, you want golden brown colour.
