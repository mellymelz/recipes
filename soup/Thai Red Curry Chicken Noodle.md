# Thai red curry and coconut chicken noodle soup

#### this was made as an experiment and i am so glad i wrote down what i put in!

## Ingredients

* 2 Tbsp coconut oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, sliced thinly
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced
* 1 celery stalk, sliced thin on bias
* 1.5 medium carrot, 1/2'd and sliced thin on bias
* 1 orange bell pepper, sliced 
#### you should have approximately equal parts celery, carrot and pepper
* 8 shiitake mushrooms, sliced (feel free to sub button mushrooms)
* 2 Tbsp Thai red curry paste (i may have done more but i like it spicy)
* 4 cups home made chicken stock (or store bought, whatever)
* 500mL coconut milk + a bit extra (probably 2 cans worth, i bought a larger than usual pkg)
* 3 pre cooked chicken thighs, shredded (could sub breast; mine were lemongrass marinaded and sous vided)
* .25 cups fresh squeezed lime juice (or more to flavor at the end)
* fish sauce to taste
* rice noodles (i used three "clumps" but you can make it less noodly or even add pre cooked jasmine rice instead!)
* cilantro

## Method

* In a large pot heat oil on med high. Add onion, cook a couple minutes then add garlic and ginger. Then add curry paste.
* Next add mushrooms, stir and cook a few minutes, until they start to shrink (let out that water!)
* Now add the rest of veggies and cook a couple minutes.
* Add stock and bring to a simmer.
* After 5 minutes add the coconut milk and return to a simmer. Add chicken.
* Adjust heat as necessary and let it happily bubble away for 20 minutes.
* Toss in your noodles and stir, they will be soft in about 5-8 minutes.
* Season with fish sauce to taste.
* Garnish with fresh cilantro <3
