# Mom's Broccoli Cheese Soup

### Mellie's all time favorite soup!

## Ingredients

- 4 cups broccoli, large florets
- 2 cups veg or chicken stock
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 tsp salt
- (optional) 1/2 Tbsp no chicken flavored powder (if using veg stock for the chicken flavor without the chicken *from bulk barn*)
- 1/4 cup flour
- 1/4 cup butter
- 2 cups milk
- 1 tsp mustard powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 4 cups shredded cheddar

## Method

- First, take out a large food processor and throw in the broccoli florets, stock, corn starch and salt.
- Pulse and blend until most of the broccoli is small, some bigger chunks may be in there still but that is OK.
- Cook the broccoli mixture just until it comes to a boil and is thickened by the cornstarch. DO NOT OVERCCOK THE BROCOLLI. 
- Pour back into the food processor bowl or a different bowl if you don't care about extra dishes. 
- In that same pot, combine flour and butter and cook a couple minutes (your blonde roux).
- Add milk and whisk together and bring to temp that it bubbles but don't scorch it. 
- Whisk in the cheese a bit at a time until it is all in and melted. Then add the broccoli mixture and heat until gently bubbling. 
- Now try not to eat it all at once!

### Notes
Seriously, i cant get enought of this soup it can be dangerously easy to over eat!
