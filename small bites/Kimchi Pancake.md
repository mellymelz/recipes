# Kimchi Pancake

Serves 1-2 depending how hungry you are!

#### from www.woksoflife.com this is a great quick snack for 2 when you are pressed for time! or have too much kimchi (is there such a thing?)

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup potato starch 
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup kimchi - roughly chopped
* 1/2 cup kimchi juice
* 3 Tbsp water
* 1 scallion, thinly sliced
* 2 Tbsp oil, for cooking
* toasted sesame seeds, garnish

## Sauce

* 1 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp water
* 1 tsp rice wine vinegar
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp sesame oil

## Method

- Stir dry ingredients together to combine.
- Add the kimchi, liquids and green onion and stir to combine. (It should resemble a pancake batter but chunky)
- Heat a non stick or cast iron pan at medium high heat. Add oil.
- Cook that pancake! 
- Stir sauce ingredients together in a small dish for dipping.
- I like to cut my pancake into pieces and then sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
