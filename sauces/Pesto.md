# Pesto

#### Ryan makes this usually for me with our motar and pestle

## Ingredients

* 2 cloves garlic
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 20g basil leaves
* 75mL olive oil
* 60g parmesan
* 30g pine nuts

## Method

- Smash garlic and salt together with motar and pestle until smooth.
- Wash and dry basil leaves and remove from stems, then coarsly chop.
- Add basil to salt/garlic paste. Pound away until mashed into a nice paste.
- Add olive oil one spoonful at a time until well incorperated.
- Grate the parmesan cheese fine then keep grinding that into the pesto.
- Chop the pine nuts a little and add last then mix until its all nice and smooth.

### Notes

You can put it all in a robout coupe and save your arms but flavorwise you can't beat the motar and pestle.
Keeps 1-2 days in fridge but you can freeze this for a few months!
