# Enchiladas

## Ingredients

* 10 4-6" flour or corn tortillas (if using corn make sure they are warm/soft so they dont crack when you roll)
* 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 avocado, diced
* 1/2 red onion, diced
* 1 tsp garlic salt
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 cup cilantro, rough chop
* 1 roma tomato, diced
* 20oz green enchilada sauce (i cheat and use a packet, i like the Fontera brand i do 3 pkg)
* 7oz canned diced green chillies (2 small cans)
* 1/2 cup shredded cheese (mozza cheddar blend or add a jalapeno jack ect)

## Method

- Preheat oven to 400F
- In a saucepan combine the enchilada sauce and green chillies and warm.
- In a large bowl combine the beans, avocado, onion, tomato, cilantro, cumin and garlic salt.
- Mix gently so you don't mash the avocado.
- Lay out the tortillas and put about 3 Tbsp of mix in each one. (i like to lay them all out and fill at same time so they are equal)
- In a glass 9x13" lay about a cup of the sauce on the bottom and make sure to cover all the bottom with sauce.
- Roll those tortillas and place in the baking dish.
- Cover with the remaining sauce and then the cheese.
- Bake 15-20 minutes.

### Notes

I have a strange friend who hates avocado and i have substituted this recipe with frozen corn and bell pepper. Still delicious. 
Helpful if you cannot get any ripe avocado either.
