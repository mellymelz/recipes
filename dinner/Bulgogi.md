# Bulgogi

#### recipe from www.savorysweetlife.com and it is beyond amazing! takes me back to my Netaholics days in Richmond <3

Servings: 4

## Ingredients

* 1/2 medium onion, sliced thin
* 2 green onion, sliced thin + more for garnish if you wish
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/3 cup soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp sesame oil
* 3 Tbsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* 2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds
* 1/4 tsp minced ginger (optional but i love ginger)
* agave or honey as needed in pan while cooking, not in marinade
* 1 - 1.5 lbs beef sliced very thin against the grain (freeze slightly to cut easier) OR sub sliced tempeh for a veggie option

## Method

- Combine all the ingredients except agave and massage into the meat for 2 minutes.
- Cover, put in fridge and let it sit overnight if its beef. If using tempeh let it sit only 2-4 hours.
- In a large cast iron pan set to a high heat and add 1-2 Tbsp oil. Cook the protien in batches so you get some carmelization.
- Taste, if you like it a little sweeter add some agave syrup and coat the beef well. 

## Notes

I love this with rice and a simple green salad with a vinegrette along with a little kimchi!
