## Ingredients

* 1 cup green lentils
* 4 cup warm water
* 2 Tbsp oil 
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 4 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1" fresh ginger, grated
* 2 small chillies finely chopped or sambal olek 
* 1/4-1/2 cup chopped cilantro
* 1 cup + 2 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp cumin seed (not powder)
* 1.5 tsp garam marsala 
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1.25 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp lemon juice

## Method

Boil lentils and 3 cups of water then reduce to medium heat, cover and cook 30 minutes.
Add extra cup of water as needed. 
When lentils are soft cover and let stand. There will be a little water left.

In a seperate pan, heat oil on med high. Add the cumin seed and crackle.
Add onion and cook until translucent. 
Add remaining ingredients except lemon juice, sugar and cilantro.
Cook a couple minutes then add to the lentil pot.
Now add the sugar, lemon juice and cilantro. Bring to a boil, then immediately turn heat off and let stand ten minutes.
Saucyness is dependant on how much water in the lentils, so you if are a saucy girl like me more water is better.
