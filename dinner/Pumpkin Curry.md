# Pumpkin Curry 

#### recipe passed down from my old co-worker, Roshni <3 

## Ingredients

* 600g-800g raw cubed pumpkin/ or squash (i never had an amount for this i just adjusted my flavors accordingly)
* 1/2 tsp mustard seed
* 1/2 tsp cumin seed
* 10 curry leaves
* 1 tsp curry powder
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* salt to taste
* 2 small chillis
* 1 onion, diced
* 2 Tbsp garlic, minced
* 2 Tbsp ginger, minced

##  Method

- Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large pot med high, add cumin seed, mustard seed and curry leaves. Crackle.
- Add ginger, garlic and onion then cook until golden.
- Add pumpkin, chillis, curry powder, turmeric and salt.
- Turn to medium/medium low and let it simmer in its own juices stirring occasionally.
- Adjust flavors by using sugar and lemon juice to taste. Turn to low and let it go until its ready.

### Notes

- Roshni also told me this is a base Indian recipe and if you were to replace pumpkin with potato and cauliflower and add a tomato you get aloo ghobi!
