# Spanakopita 

makes about 27 but depends if you make large or small

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 2 large onion, diced
- 20oz frozen spinach thawed, drained and squeezed dry
- 2 Tbsp fresh dill, chopped
- 2 Tbsp all purpose flour
- 8oz feta cheese, crumbled
- 4 eggs, lightly beaten
- Salt and Pepper TT
- 1 package phyllo, thawed
- 3/4 lb butter, melted

## Method

- In a large saute pan heat oil and cook diced onion until translucent.
- Add spinach, dill and flour and cook 10 minutes or until moisture is removed. Remove from heat.
- Let cool slightly then add the feta, eggs and season.
- Brush phyllo with butter and spoon mix on then fold into triangles.
- Bake at 350F 45min-1hr

### Notes

I tend to make these larger but if you make smaller the cooking time will be less. If you are unsure how to fold the phyllo into triangles just google it lol.
