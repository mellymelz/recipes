# Penne with Chorizo

#### something my mom made me <3

## Ingredients

- 200g penne
- 200g chorizo
- 200g cream cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Tbsp fennel seed
- 2 cups broccoli, chopped
- 1-2 cups arugula
- 1/2 cup parmesan 

## Method

- Cook penne until al dente, then set aside.
- In a large saute pan, cook chorizo sausage and fennel seed. You can squeeze out of the casings to make nice bite sized chunks or cook and slice.
- Once the sausage is mostly cooked add the garlic and broccoli.
- When your broccoli is almost cooked add the cream cheese and parmesan and stir until it melts together.
- Add arugula, cooked penne and season to taste.

### Notes
I did this without fennel seed, no problem if you don't have. Also if you are pressed for time, cook the broccoli in the penne 2 minutes before it comes out.
Think about the size you cut your broccoli to cook time, if its big give it longer! Rinse the penne and broccoli with cold water and set aside in that case.
