# Beef Stroganoff

## Ingredients

* 2 lb stew meat or a chuck roast cut into cubes
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 yellow onion diced
* 2 garlic cloves minced 
* 2 c water
* 2 tsp better than bouillon beef base see note below
* 10 oz egg noodles

### Sauce

* 1 c sour cream
* 3 tbsp flour
* 1.5 tbsp tomato paste

## Method
 
* Pat the meat with a paper towel to remove excess moisture
* Sprinkle on the season-all, salt and pepper
* Heat a saute pan over medium heat 
* Add the olive oil and in batches, add the stew meat and sear the edges
* Set the seared meat aside on a plate
* Once all the meat is on the plate, drizzle a little more olive oil onto the pan
* Add the onion, garlic and a pinch of salt
* Sauté for 3-5 minutes on med/low heat
* Add in the water and beef bouillon base, scraping the bottom with a whisk to get all the bits stuck to the bottom, incorporated with the broth
* Add the stew meat and plate drippings back to the pan, bring to a boil then reduce the heat and cover
* Simmer on low for 2 hours
* Once the meat is done, cook the egg noodles in boiling water until al dente, no firmer to avoid mushy noodles – best to keep a watchful eye on them!
* Mix the sour cream, flour, tomato paste and pepper in a bowl, whisking until smooth
* Add a few spoonful of hot broth to the sour cream mixture, whisking it around to incorporate
* Add all of the sour cream mixture to the sauté pan with the meat and broth, whisking constantly until totally combined
* It may look lumpy for a bit but it will smooth out
* Add in the egg noodles
* Serve!
