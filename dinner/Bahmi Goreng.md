# Bahmi Goreng

Dutch Indonesian dish of great deliciousness
Makes 10 servings 

## Ingredients

- coconut oil or cooking oil
- 1 large sweet onion, diced
- 2 large leek, sliced (wash well first!!!)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Tbsp ginger, minced
- 1 large red pepper, sliced
- 5 kale leaves, despined and sliced
- 5 stalks celery, thinly sliced
- 1 large head Chinese cabbage, thinly sliced
- 400g bean sprouts
- Kroepeck (shrimp crackers for side)
- eggs, fried for on top at end if you like (i do!)
- 1 bag medium egg noodles
- 600g chicken or pork sliced finely OR 250g package of smoked tofu for the veg version
- 1 pkg Conimex Bahmi Groenten spice mix (gotta find a dutch store for this)

### Peanut Sauce

- 2/3 cup peanut butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp sambal olek
- 1 Tbsp ketjap manis (or soy sauce)
- 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 Tbsp water
*honestly, i usually double my peanut sauce recipe, its so good*

## Method

- Empty the package of spice mix in a metal bowl and pour 1/3 cup boiling hot water over the seasoning. You will add the browned meat or tofu to this later.
- Cook the noodles until al dente, drain, rinse with cold water and set aside.
- You need a BIG pot for this, heat coconut oil and cook your protien of choice, then set aside in the spice mix/water mix.
- In that same pot heat a bit more coconut oil on medium high heat: add ALL the veggies, cover and allow them to steam for about 5 minutes.
- Now go ahead and add protien with spice mix and stir it all up.
- High heat and stirring every couple minutes to cook off the excess liquid, you don't want it too wet.
- Lastly stir in the cooked noodles.

### Notes 

TRADITIONALLY; the peanut sauce is served on the side along with the Kroepeck but my mom likes to mix the peanut sauce into the bahmi and i find that saves you from mixing on your plate.
Don't forget a fried egg on top and some extra sambal olek !!! OM NOM NOM.
