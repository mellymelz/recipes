# Creamy Portobello and Red Pepper Curry on Paneer

recipe from Vij's Rangoli 

## Ingredients

- 1 32oz carton heavy cream
- 2.5 Tbsp lemon juice
- 2/3 cup vegetable oil
- 7-8 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 6 portobello mushrooms, cut in 1/2" slices
- 3 red peppers, cut into 1/2" slices
- 1 large red onion, finely sliced
- 1 Tbsp cumin
- 1 tsp salt
- 12 1/4" slices of paneer

## Directions 

- To make the curry sauce, stir together cream and lemon juice in a medium bowl; set aside.
- In a large pan, heat Â¼ cup of vegetable oil over medium heat for 1 minute; add the chopped garlic and stir until garlic browns, about 3-4 minutes
- Add turmeric, salt, paprika, and cayenne to the pan and continue stirring for another 2-3 minutes; remove pan from heat and pour the spice mixture into the lemon and cream mixture. 
- To deglaze the pan, pour a small amount of the curry cream back into the pan and scrape down the sides; return the cream to the bowl and set curry cream aside at room temperature while you cook the vegetables. 
- Heat the remaining oil in a clean medium pan over medium-high heat for 45 seconds; add the red onion and cook while stirring for 5 minutes, or until the onion starts to soften and brown around the edges.
- Add the cumin and stir another 1 minute before adding the mushroom and peppers to the pan. 
- Cook and stir the vegetables for 3 minutes, or until peppers start to soften; remove the pan from heat and cool for 5 minutes. 
- Once the vegetables have cooled, pour the reserved curry cream into the pan with the fried mushrooms and peppers. 
- Cook and stir over medium-high heat until the curry comes to a boil; immediately reduce heat to medium and continue to cook until the peppers are soft, about 3-4 minutes. 
- Arrange 2 slices of paneer on each plate. Top the paneer with a generous helping of curry and serve. 

### Notes

I literally c & p this recipe from Vij's. I have made this recipe a few times and the mushrooms and peppers are A LOT so i found cooking a bit in a hot cast iron pan alone before adding into the curry was helpful.
