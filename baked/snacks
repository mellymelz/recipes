# Candied Pecans

#### Must have from Mel at Christmas

## Ingredients
- 5lbs pecan halves
- 5 large egg whites or 10 Tbsp of pasturized egg whites
- 5 Tbsp water
- 2.5 tsp vanilla
- 5 cups granulated sugar
- 5 tsp cinnamon (I usually heap my scoops)
- 2.5 tsp salt

## Method
- Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Line 3 large sheet pans with parchment paper.
- In a large mixing bowl, whisk together egg whites, water and vanilla until very frothy.
- In a seperate bowl mix together sugar, salt and cinnamon.
- Add pecans to the frothy egg mixture and toss until evenly coated.
- Pour sugar mixture over the coated pecans and toss until evenly coated, use a firm rubber spatula to really get in there.
- Arrange pecans evenly over the 3 large lined baking sheets in an even layer.
- Bake, taking out every 20 minutes to turn. Should be 1 hour minimum but I often let them go an extra 15 minutes.
- Cool then store in sealed container.

####Notes
- Keep at room temp 1-2 weeks if they last that long, freeze if you want to store for a long time.
