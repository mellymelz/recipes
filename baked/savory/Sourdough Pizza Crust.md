# Sourdough Pizza Dough

#### Makes 4 12" pizzas
#### original recipe from https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe/

## Indgredients

- scant ½ cup (100 g) sourdough starter discard
- 2 teaspoons (10 g) fine sea salt
- 2 tablespoons (30 g) olive oil
- ⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon (50 g) whole wheat flour
- 3 ¾ cups (450 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 ⅓ cups + 2 tablespoons (350 g) water

## Method

### The night before: 
- Add the pizza crust ingredients to a large mixing bowl and use your hands to mix until they are fully incorporated. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to ferment at room temperature overnight.
### The next morning: 
- Perform a set of stretch and folds. Wet your hand with water to prevent the dough from sticking. While the dough is still in the bowl, gently pull one side of the dough up and over itself. Turn the bowl and repeat this on all sides of the dough until you turned the bowl full circle. 
- Cover the bowl and place in the fridge, up to 36 hours until ready to bake. (The dough can be used at this point to make your pizza, the cold ferment is optional.)
### That night:
- Remove the dough and let rest on the counter for 30 minutes to come to room temperature. 
- Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and on a generously floured work surface, shape each portion into ball shape. Cover the mounds with a tea towel let rest 30 minutes. 
- Turn on your oven's broiler and heat a cast iron skillet over medium to medium-high heat. While the skillet is preheating, use your hands to press a ball of dough into an 8" circle on a floured surface. Use more flour as needed to prevent sticking. (If you find the dough difficult to shape into a pizza crust, let it to rest on the counter for 15 minutes in order for the gluten to relax.)
- When the skillet is hot, lay the circle of dough onto the skillet. Immediately place the sauce and toppings on the crust and cook for 5-6 minutes or until the bottom of the crust is starting to char. 
- Once the bottom has turned brown and charred, transfer the cast iron skillet to the broiler to finish baking the top of the pizza 2-4 minutes. Remove, slice and serve hot.

#### Notes

- If you do not have an oven-safe or cast iron skillet, start the pizza on the stove-top in a non-stick skillet. (If it is not a non-stick skillet, spray a little cooking oil to prevent the crust from sticking.) When the pizza is ready to go under the broiler, carefully slide the crust onto a baking sheet to finish it. (You can also try to use a large spatula to transfer the crust to a baking sheet.)
