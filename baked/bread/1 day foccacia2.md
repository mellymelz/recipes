# 1 Day Foccacia

## Ingredients

- 500g bread flour
- 420g warm water
- 8g active dry yeast
- 5g honey
- 15g olive oil
- 10g salt

## Method

- Mix warm water, yeast and honey and let bloom 5-10 min.
- Add oil and salt next, stir then add flour and mix until no dry bits.
- Cover and rest for 15 min.
- Do one set of folds, then cover and rest 15 min.
- Do 2nd set of folds, then flip dough ball and tuck in and place seam side down. Cover and rest 1.5 hr.
- Oil a 9x13" pan and line bottom with parchment paper. Oil parchment as well.
- Release dough from bowl with a scraper, into the prepared pan.
- Oil your hands and fold the dough; pulling one side to the middle then repeat with the other side, then fold into thirds (it will look like a burrito). Flip so seams are on the bottom of the pan.
- Cover with another tray that is inverted to seal in moisture. (parchment or cloth or plastic with 100% stick, don't do it!) Proof 1.25 - 2 hrs depending on temperature.
- Preheat oven to 430F.
- Oil the dough and your hands then smush in and make them dimples.
- Sprinkle with your flavourings of choice. If you are adding something like olives, tomatoes etc. be sure to presss them into the dough a bit so they don't burn.
- Bake 18-22 min on the lowest oven rack or until golden brown.
- Cool a few minutes then transfer to rack.
- Wait 15 min before you dig in (test that willpower!)
