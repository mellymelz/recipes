## Method

- Preheat oven to 375F and butter the pan.

- Use a pastry blender or fingers and cut 1/2 cup of butter into the flour mixture until butter pieces are pea sized.
- Transfer 1/4 cup of the butter/flour mix to a seperate bowl and add remaining 2 Tbsp sugar and remaining Tbsp of butter. This is the crumble topping!
- In a small bowl, whisk together sour cream, egg and vanilla. 
- Add the spices to the flour mix (not the crumble mix)
- Stir wet into flour mix then fold in blueberries. (it will be thick)
- Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle with the crumble topping.

- Cool on a rack 15-20 minutes before cutting in or it will be too tender to handle!
