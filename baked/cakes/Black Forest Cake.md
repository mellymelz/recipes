# Black Forest Cake

3 x 9" cake pans, line with parchment

## Ingredients

### Cake

- 1 2/3 cup all purpose flour
- 2/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1.5 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup shortening
- 1.5 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1.5 cup buttermilk

### Filling

- 1/2 cup kirsch 
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 3 cups icing sugar
- 1/4 cup espresso
- 1.5 lb cherries, pitted and set aside about 12 for topping

### Icing

- 2 cup whipping cream
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 1/8 cup kirsch
- 2 Tbsp powdered milk
- 2 Tbsp icing sugar
- 1/2 cup shaved chocolate
- 12 cherries

## Method

- For filling, soak pitted cherries overnight in kirsch.
- Pre heat oven to 350F.
- Sift together flour, cocoa and baking powder, set aside.
- In a large bowl, cream together shortening and sugar, then add eggs and vanilla.
- Add buttermilk alternating with the dry ingredients.
- Pour into cake prepared cake pans and bake 20 minutes (or longer, just bake it till its done haha) then cool cake completely to assemble.
- Filling; beat butter until light and creamy then add icing sugar and espresso and a pinch of salt.
- If filling is too thick add a little kirsch.
- Cut soaked cherries in half and set aside.
- For icing; whip cream until stiff peaks form.
- (Icing) Fold in the powdered milk and icing sugar then add the vanilla and kirsch and fold in until a nice consistancy.
- The fully cooled cakes poke with a toothpick and coat with the kirsch the cherries soaked in.
- To build your cake; first a layer of cake, then a layer of filling, then a layer of cherries followed by cake, filling, cherries and topped with third cake.
- Let that sit covered in the fridge again for another day if you can to really let the boozy cherry goodness be fully in everywhere.
- To Serve! Cover outside with the Icing and top with the dozen cherries you saved from beginning ( i know, its been days?! ) and the shaved chocolate.

### Notes

If you like a lot of cream on the outside (or fancy piping) you may want to double the icing recipe.
