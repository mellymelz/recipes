# Mocha Frosting

This is from my mom, it was on a chocolate cake every birthday since i can remember cake <3

## Ingredients

- 3 cup heavy cream
- 1.5 cup icing sugar
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 2 tsp instant coffee/espresso

## Method

- Mix cream and instant coffee, let sit 1/2hr-overnight.
- Add remaining ingredients and whip!

### Notes

If you use this you must keep your cake in the fridge! (seems obvious but i can't let this go to waste haha)

Also, if you are making a bigger cake or lots of cupcakes you will probably want to make more.... its so good.
