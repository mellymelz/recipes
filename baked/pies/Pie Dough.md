# Pie Dough(s)

#### I have tried many but this one always gives me the flaky crust of champions

## Ingredients

* 1.5lb pastry flour
* 1.5oz milk powder
* 13oz shortening
* 7oz COLD water
* 1/2-1/4oz salt

## Method

Blend flour and milk powder. 
Add shortening and cut into flour until pea sized. (For a mealy dough crumb size)
Dissolve salt in water.
Add all water at once to fat flour mix.
Since i do this in my stand mixer i use paddle attachment and set to speed 1 JUST until dough comes together.
Wrap and chill the dough.

### Notes

This makes more than one pie shell, if you want to freeze the extra dough then you got pies for later!
Roll out about 1/8" thickness.
