# Lemon Bars!!!

Makes 2 dozen squares original recipe by Nicole Rees

Amazing shortbread crust... tangy lemon curd... how could you go wrong?!

## Shortbread Crust

- 7oz unsalted butter, melted and cooled until just warm
- 2 cup all purpose flour
- .5 cup sugar
- .5 tsp salt

## Lemon Curd

- 4 large eggs
- 1.25 cup sugar
- 3 Tbsp all purpose flour
- 1/8 tsp salt
- .75 cup lemon juice (fresh squeezed is a must here)
- 1 Tbsp grated lemon zest

## Method

First things first, the crust!

- Line a 13"x9" baking pan with foil, leaving an overhanging edge for easy removal. Lightly butter the sides of the foil (not the bottom).
- In a medium bowl, stir together the butter, sugar and salt until just combined. Add the butter and stir until dough just comes together.
- Press the mixture evenly into the pan. Prick the dough with a fork. Refridgerate for 30 minutes or freeze for 5-7 minutes. Until dough is firm.
- Preheat the oven to 325F. Bake 25 minutes, until the crust begins to set but has not begun to brown at the edges. (Centre will not yet be firm)

- In a different medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, flour and salt until smooth, about 1 minute. 
- Whisk in the lemon juice and zest.
- Pour filling over the hot crust. Return pan to the oven and increase the heat to 350F. 
- Bake for 20 minutes or until the center is set and the edges are golden. The topping will no longer wiggle when the pan is moved.
- Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 1-2 hours. When the bottom is cool, carefully lift the bars fromm the pan using the overhanging foil.
- Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 2" squares. Dust with icing sugar before serving.
