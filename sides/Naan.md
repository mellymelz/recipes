# Naan

## Ingredients

* 1 Tbsp yeast
* 1 cup warm water
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 3 Tbsp milk
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 4.5 cup all purpose flour
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 1/4 cup melted butter

## Method

Combine yeast water and a small part of the sugar and let it set 10 minutes until frothy.
Stir in rest of sugar, milk, egg, salt and enought flour to make a soft dough (not all at once!)
Knead 6-8 minutes on a lightly floured surface or until smooth. 
Let rise one hour in an oiled bowl covered with a damp cloth.
Punch down the dough and knead in the garlic now.
Pinch off handfuls of dough and roll into golf ball sized balls.
Cover and rise 30 minutes.
Roll them out as cooking. 
Heat a cast iron pan and add some oil then cook the pan bread.
I like to add a lid to help partially steam the bread as its cooking since i dont have a real tandoor oven lol.
Brush with melted butter.
