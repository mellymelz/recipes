# Garlic Parmesan Butter Roasted Potatoes

#### Original recipe: https://www.eatwell101.com/garlic-parmesan-butter-roasted-potatoes
#### 8 servings

## Ingredients

- 8 medium-sized potatoes, thoroughly washed
- 4 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 cup parmesan
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic (or garlic powder)
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

## Method

- Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°F).
- Cut a thin lengthwise slice off the bottom of each potato to make them more stable. Place 2 chopsticks on opposite long sides of 1 potato on your cutting board. Cut potato crosswise into thin slices, stopping when your knife hits the chopsticks. Repeat with remaining potatoes.
- Pour melted butter on top of potatoes and brush to coat between the slices.
- In a shallow plate or bowl, combine parmesan, black pepper, minced garlic, paprika, salt, and Italian seasoning. Sprinkle the mixture over the potatoes and between the slices to coat them completely. Transfer to a baking dish.
- Bake in the oven for 40 minutes to one hour, until golden and cooked through. 

#### Note: Cooking time will depend on your oven and the size of your potatoes. The smaller, the quicker!
