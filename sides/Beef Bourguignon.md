#### Burgoo Recipe

## Ingredients

* 3lbs beef chuck, cut into 2" cubes
* 5-6 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 4-5 medium carrots, diced
* 1 bottle red wine (yes you read that right!)
* 1/4 cup tomato paste
* 3 bay leaves
* 3 Tbsp potato starch
* 3 cups beef stock
* 1lb button mushrooms
* 40 pearl onions, peeled
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 1 bunch parsley, chopped

## Method

Preheat oven to 350F.
Dry the meat and season with salt and pepper. Heat large heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven to high.
Brown beef on all sides in batches and set aside.
Add the onion and carrot to the pot, saute for 3-4 minutes then add garlic and go another minute.
Then add tomato paste, cook 2 minutes.
Deglaze pot with red wine, save 1/2 cup of wine for later.
Add stock and bay leaves and bring to a boil.
Use extra wine you held off and mix with starch to make a slurry.
Whisk slurry into sauce, add beef to pot, cover, and put it in the oven.
While beef is braising, saute and brown the pearl onions, set aside.
Repeat with mushrooms. 
Then add the browned mushrooms and onions to the pot with the fresh thyme and half the parsley.
Stir, then cook 2 hours. Replenish with stock or wine if it reduces too much. 
Garnish with parsley.
